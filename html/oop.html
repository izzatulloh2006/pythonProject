            What is object-oriented programming?
        </h1>
        <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold">
            Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.<br>

        <p style="color: red;">
            OOP focuses on the objects <b> that developers </b> want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.
